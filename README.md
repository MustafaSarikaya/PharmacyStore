# SEG3102 Project Repository - Team 3

**Branch deliverable**: Deliverable 2 *(Domain)*

**Note**:  While we have done everything we could to ensure our design stays consistent, there may still be some consistency issues in some realization diagrams and in the code; both are due to the time constraint. For the same reason, even though testStubs code was fully implemented, we could not fully finish implementing BDD testing.
